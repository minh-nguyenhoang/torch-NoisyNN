# Unofficial Pytorch implementation of NoisyNN

From paper [NoisyNN: Exploring the Influence of Information Entropy Change in Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10625v2)

This implementation is inspired from [kytimmylai's implementation](https://github.com/kytimmylai/NoisyNN-PyTorch/tree/main)

This implementation using Pytorch's hook mechanism to alter the model behaviour, so you don't have to rewrite any of your model source code.
